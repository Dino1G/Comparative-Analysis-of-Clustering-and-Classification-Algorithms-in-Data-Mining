## Abstract

In this study, we explore four common data mining analysis methods, including two types of cluster analysis and two types of classification analysis. The cluster analysis section uses K-means for partitioning and DBSCAN for density-based clustering, while the classification analysis employs logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM). This README provides an overview of the key sections and findings of the coursework.

## Introduction

In the era of big data, various analytics methods are available, including cluster analytics and classification analytics. Cluster analysis aims to group similar data, while classification analysis assigns class labels to data points. The methods explored in this study include K-means, DBSCAN, logistic regression, and SVM.

## Pre-processing

Data pre-processing is essential to ensure data quality. This section describes the steps taken to clean and standardize the data, including the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

## Clustering

The clustering section presents the results of two clustering algorithms: K-means and DBSCAN. Visualizations and findings related to these algorithms are discussed.

## Classification

The classification section evaluates the performance of logistic regression and SVM. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are reported for both algorithms. Decision boundaries are visualized to demonstrate the classification results.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this study compares different data mining methods and their performance on the dataset used. It discusses the effectiveness of clustering and classification algorithms and suggests areas for future research.
